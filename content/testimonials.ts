    body: "We joined the club as a family, in many ways to give our children the experience of learning a martial art. We couldn't have imagined how significant the experience would be for all of us. From family time together each week, to the pride that comes from disciplined practice, to learning from our instructors that possess such an incredible depth of knowledge, we are thankful for this journey that we are all on together. Sincere gratitude goes out to the ISKF and our amazing Senseis and teachers. We look forward to many more years to come.",

    body: "I wanted to learn some form of martial arts my entire life, yet I simply never took the requisite initiative to act on that interest …….. until my wife saw a picture in the Halifax Herald in December of 2019.  The picture was of Sam Campbell (6th dan) and John DeMont (5th dan) training at the Halifax ISKF dojo, and it was linked to a recruitment effort they were leading to establish a new group to be called the ‘Silver Cranes’. Anyone 55 and over (now changed to 50 and over) was welcome to join and prior karate experience was not required.  My wife handed me the article and simply said: ‘here you go, no more excuses, sign yourself up right now or I will do it on your behalf”.  Well, I did just that, the first class was in January 2020, it included 14 inaugural Silver Cranes, and was co-led by Sempais Sam and John.  I was 57 at the time and one part of my brain was saying: ”is it way too late to be starting down this path?”, while another part was saying: “this could prove to be a uniquely rewarding opportunity”.  Well, the second voice has proven to be 100% correct. \n Now just shy of 4 years with the club, I can say in all sincerity that the journey has been truly exceptional given that it has encompassed the right balance of challenge & reward, healthy exercise, intense concentration, learning how to get comfortable being uncomfortable, and last but not least genuine camaraderie.  I am truly thankful for the exemplary commitment to excellence of Senseis Tony and Danny, in parallel with their dedication to ensuring a culture within the club that is respectful, welcoming, encouraging, and inclusive. The time and effort that every single instructor has dedicated to teaching all of us is genuinely appreciated, and I extend a very special thank you to Sam Campbell, John DeMont, and Antal Prokecz for so unselfishly sharing their expertise and wisdom, along with unwavering encouragement – they are gifted karetakas and exceptional human beings that I am very lucky to call friends.",

    body: "I joined the club on January 2012 at the time when I started my master’s degree. My goal when I first joined the club was to keep myself active to be productive at school; but what I found was great instructors and trainees who provided and still providing all kind of supports to help you to improve yourself. And now I have my third black belt degree and a number of medals and trophies (provincially and nationally). Training karate helped me as a graduate student (master & PhD) to have active body and sharp mind. Great classes from great instructors. You should try it , you won’t regret!",

    body: "I have been practicing Karate in Germany, Japan, England and Canada, and this club is as good as it gets. We practice Karate-do, an art to seek perfection of character, and we are so lucky to have such true high-level instructors who lead by example. So it is no surprise that we have a large and awesome membership who respect each other and welcomes everyone with a true heart. This is not a fighting school for  wannabe ninjas or showoffs, but where we all work hard to try our best to find the perfect form. I highly recommend this club if you are interested in true karate-do.",
